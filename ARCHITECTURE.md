# Hoops Commentary Generator - Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and technical design of the Hoops Commentary Generator application.

## System Overview

The Hoops Commentary Generator is a web application that allows users to upload short basketball video clips and receive AI-generated commentary. The system processes the video, analyzes the content, generates appropriate commentary, converts it to speech, and combines it with the original video.

## Components

### Frontend

The frontend is built using modern web technologies:

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for structure
- **CSS3**: Styling with responsive design (using Tailwind CSS)
- **JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity and API communication

### Backend (Planned)

In a production environment, the backend would include:

- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express**: Web framework for API endpoints
- **TensorFlow.js**: For computer vision and video analysis
- **FFmpeg**: For video processing and merging audio/video
- **Cloud Storage**: For storing videos and processed results

## Data Flow

1. **User Upload**: User uploads a video file (client-side validation for format/size)
2. **Video Analysis**: 
   - Extract key frames from the video
   - Detect basketball actions (dribble, pass, shot, dunk, etc.)
   - Identify player positions and movements
3. **Commentary Generation**:
   - Process video analysis results
   - Generate contextual commentary based on detected actions
   - Adapt to user-selected style and keywords
4. **Audio Synthesis**:
   - Convert text commentary to speech
   - Adjust timing to match video actions
5. **Media Combination**:
   - Combine original video with generated audio
   - Sync audio with video events
6. **Delivery**:
   - Provide downloadable video with commentary
   - Enable social sharing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Video Upload and Processing

- Use HTML5 File API for client-side file handling
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality
- Validate video format (MP4, WebM, etc.) and size
- Generate video preview using HTML5 video element

### Commentary Generation

The commentary generation system follows these steps:

1. **Video Analysis**:
   - Extract frames at regular intervals
   - Use TensorFlow.js models to identify basketball elements:
     - Players and their positions
     - Ball movement
     - Court elements
     - Action types (shot, pass, dribble, etc.)

2. **Content Generation**:
   - Map detected actions to commentary templates
   - Apply selected style (Excitable, Analytical, Old School)
   - Incorporate user-provided keywords
   - Generate coherent narrative that matches the video

3. **Voice Synthesis**:
   - Use Web Speech API for prototype
   - For production: Cloud-based TTS services for higher quality audio
   - Apply voice characteristics based on commentary style

### Video Combination

In the prototype, we simulate the video combination process. In a production environment:

- Use FFmpeg (via WebAssembly or server-side) to combine video and audio
- Ensure proper synchronization of commentary with visual actions
- Optimize output for quality and file size

## Security Considerations

- Validate all file uploads
- Limit file sizes to prevent abuse
- Sanitize user inputs for keywords
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Use secure storage for user-uploaded content

## Scalability

The architecture supports scaling through:

- Separation of concerns between components
- Stateless API design
- Asynchronous processing for intensive tasks
- Cloud-based deployment for dynamic scaling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Video Analysis**:
   - Player recognition
   - Team identification
   - Score detection
   - More detailed action classification

2. **Enhanced Commentary**:
   - Multiple commentator voices
   - Background crowd noise
   - Statistical insights
   - Team-specific knowledge

3. **Social Features**:
   - User accounts
   - Saved videos
   - Community sharing
   - Commentary customization

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Frontend prototype with simulated functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Implement basic video analysis and commentary generation
3. **Phase 3**: Add audio synthesis and video combination
4. **Phase 4**: Enhance UI/UX and add advanced features
5. **Phase 5**: Deploy to production with full backend support

## Technical Debt and Limitations

- The current prototype uses client-side processing, which is limited by browser capabilities
- Web Speech API has inconsistent support across browsers
- Video processing in the browser is resource-intensive
- Future versions would move heavy processing to the server
